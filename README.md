# 🌍 ConnecTM - Smart City Issue Tracker 🌍

**ConnecTM** is a Smart City solution developed for the **ITFest Hackathon** in the **Smart City** track. This app allows citizens to report issues in their city, such as broken benches, fallen trees, potholes, and more, by pinpointing them on an interactive map. With the ability to categorize and flag these issues, **ConnecTM** aims to improve urban living by helping city authorities stay informed and take action quickly.

Built using **JavaScript**, this app features an easy-to-use interface where users can submit issues, while providing an **Admin Page** for city officials to manage and assign tasks for fixing the reported issues.

## 🚀 Features

- **🗺️ Interactive Map:** Citizens can pinpoint issues (e.g., broken benches, potholes) on a map to easily highlight problems in their city.
- **⚠️ Issue Reporting:** Users can report issues by categorizing them (e.g., Infrastructure, Environment, etc.) and providing additional details to help resolve them.
- **🔄 Real-Time Updates:** As new issues are reported, the map is updated instantly, allowing citizens and authorities to stay informed in real-time.
- **👩‍💻 Admin Dashboard:** City authorities can log in to the admin page to view reported issues and assign tasks to specific personnel or teams.
- **✅ Task Assignment:** Administrators can track the status of each issue and assign it to relevant departments for resolution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** For building the interactive and dynamic features of the app.
- **Map API (e.g., Google Maps, Leaflet):** Used to render the interactive map where users can mark locations of issues.
- **CSS:** For styling and ensuring the app is responsive and visually appealing on all devices.
- **Admin Dashboard:** An admin interface to manage reported issues and track progress.
